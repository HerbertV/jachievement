# JAchievement

## The library

**JAchievement** is a small library written in Java that provides achievement notification features to any Java application. First of all, I think it is better to explain what is an achievement in this context. If you own a XBox 360, you probably know what an achievement is.

According to Wikipedia, an achievement, also sometimes known as a trophy or challenge, is a meta-goal defined outside of a game's parameters. Unlike the systems of quests or levels that usually define the goals of a computer or video game and have a direct effect on further gameplay in the form of unlocking other quests or special features, the management of achievements usually takes place outside the confines of the game environment and architecture.

Perhaps you may ask what is the reason of this library. Personally, I love the Microsoft Gamescore System and I really believe all these secondary meta-goals contribute to the user experience. What if NetBeans has an achievement system, e.g., write your first regular expression, or compile your first application? JAchievement is an interesting achievement notification library!
