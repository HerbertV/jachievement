{"body":"JAchievement 2.1\r\n================\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\n*JAchievement* is a small library written in Java that provides achievement notification features to any Java application. In short, this library provides an easy way for you to display achievements within an application.\r\n\r\n![Achievement 1](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/screen02.png)\r\n\r\nThe authors\r\n-----------\r\n*JAchievement* is maintained by Antoine Neveux &nbsp;![France](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/france.png)&nbsp;&nbsp; and Paulo Roberto Massa Cereda &nbsp;![Brazil](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/brazil.png).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nThis library is licensed under the [New BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\nAll the technical documentation (destinated to potential contributors) can be found directly in the source code: there's quite a lot of JavaDoc, so understanding the source code shouldn't be a problem. From an user point of view, all the documentation can be found [on the JAchievement dedicated website](http://cereda.github.com/jachievement/). Some advanced documentation can also be found on [our GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/wiki).\r\n\r\nDownloads\r\n---------\r\nThe `.jar` files can be found on [our GitHub downloads page](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/downloads). One of the `jar` contains all the dependencies, so it can be used without anything else, while the other one contains only the *JAchievement* classes, so you'll need to add the dependencies manually to your application's classpath. And you can also get a zip file of the source code [from the GitHub ZipBall feature](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/zipball/master).\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\nWe'd be really happy if you'd like to fork *JAchievement*. Feel free to submit some [pull requests](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/pulls). And don't hesitate to submit [issues](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/issues) too, if you have some comments about our work!\r\n\r\nContact us\r\n----------\r\nYou can contact us through our Twitter accounts, [@antoineneveux](http://www.twitter.com/antoineneveux) and [@paulocereda](http://www.twitter.com/paulocereda), but of course there are other ways of reaching us:\r\n\r\n- Antoine Neveux &nbsp;[![Homepage](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/email.png)](http://www.antoineneveux.fr/) &nbsp;[![Twitter](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/twitter.png)](http://www.twitter.com/antoineneveux)\r\n- Paulo Roberto Massa Cereda &nbsp;[![Homepage](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/email.png)](http://cereda.users.sourceforge.net/) &nbsp;[![Twitter](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/twitter.png)](http://www.twitter.com/paulocereda)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks\r\n--------------\r\nTo these two libraries used in the project: [Trident](http://www.pushing-pixels.org/category/trident) and [MigLayout](http://www.miglayout.com/).\r\n","tagline":"An achievement notification library","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
