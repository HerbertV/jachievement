The authors
-----------
*JAchievement* is maintained by Antoine Neveux &nbsp;![France](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/france.png)&nbsp;&nbsp; and Paulo Roberto Massa Cereda &nbsp;![Brazil](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/images/brazil.png).

License
-------
This library is licensed under the [New BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).

Documentation
-------------
All the technical documentation (destinated to potential contributors) can be found directly in the source code: there's quite a lot of JavaDoc, so understanding the source code shouldn't be a problem. From an user point of view, all the documentation can be found [on the JAchievement dedicated website](http://cereda.github.com/jachievement/). Some advanced documentation can also be found on [our GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/wiki).

Downloads
---------
The `.jar` files can be found on [our GitHub downloads page](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/downloads). One of the `jar` contains all the dependencies, so it can be used without anything else, while the other one contains only the *JAchievement* classes, so you'll need to add the dependencies manually to your application's classpath. And you can also get a zip file of the source code [from the GitHub ZipBall feature](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/zipball/master).
