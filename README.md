================
About
-----
**JAchievement** is a small library written in Java that provides achievement notification features to any Java application.
License
-------
This library is licensed under the [New BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).
Documentation
-------------
All the technical documentation (destinated to potential contributors) can be found directly in the source code: there's quite a lot of javadoc, so understanding the source code shouldn't be a problem.
From an user point of view, all the documentation can be found [on JAchievement dedicated website](http://jachievement.sourceforge.net/).
Some advanced documentation can also be found on [our github wiki](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/wiki).
Downloads
---------
The JARs files can be found on [our github downloads page](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/downloads).
One of the jar contains all the dependencies, so it can be used without anything else, while the other one contains only the JAchievement classes, so you'll need to add the dependencies manually to your application's classpath.
And you can also get a zip file of the source code [from github zipball feature](https://github.com/cereda/jachievement/zipball/master).
